Description:

  Generates the migrations necessary for the Ruote workflow and BPM engine

Example:

  ./script/generate ruote_plugin basic

    will create :

      db/migrate/xxx_create_workitems.rb
      db/migrate/xxx_create_history.rb

    This is for the basic scenario, database persistence is only for workitems
    and the engine history.


  ./script/generate ruote_plugin all

    will create

      db/migrate/xxx_create_workitems.rb
      db/migrate/xxx_create_history.rb

    and

      db/migrate/xxx_create_expressions.rb
      db/migrate/xxx_create_process_errors.rb

    Use this one if you want the persistence of the engine to go to
    the database as well.
